1	encode	Encode regions	Regions that were examined in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">Encode</a> pilot project.	1877426
2	genomicctg	Genomic contigs	The largest contigs constructed by the Genome Reference Consortium, <a rel="external" href="http://genomereference.org">GRC</a>, for this genomic assembly.	100530253
3	tilepath	Tilepath	BAC clones upon which the current genomic assembly was based.  Colours indicate a finished sequence (gold clones), phase 1 sequencing (dark pink), phase 0 (light pink) or other (grey).  Clones that have been fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped are marked with a black triangle in the top left corner.  If a clone is shown in outline, the mapping to the genome is problematic and the true length may not be displayed.	415268
4	cloneset_1mb	1Mb clone set	Clones were selected at approximately 1MB intervals in the genome to help identify breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements.  Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped clones are marked by a black triangle in the upper left corner.  Gold clones are also in the tilepath.	287873
5	cloneset_32k	32k clone set	Clones were re-arrayed by and available at <a rel="external" href="http://bacpac.chori.org/pHumanMinSet.htm">CHORI</a>. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped clones are marked by a black triangle in the upper left corner.  Gold clones are also in the tilepath.	299090
6	cloneset_30k	30k clone set	Clone positions were determined by a Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute  <a rel="external" href="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/perl/application?action=arraytypes;array_id=20">internal project</a>.	344400
9	encode_excluded	ENCODE excluded regions	Genomic regions that have been identified as problematic in the human genome by the ENCODE project. These regions contain abnormally high unique-mapping read coverage signal in open chromatin and control/input datasets across many cell lines and are classified as dispersed high mappability artifacts, dispersed low mappability artifacts, satellite repeats, centromeric repeats, telomeric repeats or snRNA repeats.	160601
