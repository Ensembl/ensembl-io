Parser - An abstract parser class

=head2 new

    Constructor
    Argument [1+]: Hash of parameters for configuration, e.g. buffer sizes or 
                   specific functions for handling headers or data
    Returntype   : Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Parser

=cut

=head2 shift_block

    Description: Wrapper for user defined functions 
                 Loads the buffered data as current, then stores a new block of data
                 into the waiting buffer.
    Returntype : Void

=head2 next_block

    Description: Wrapper for user defined functions 
                 Goes through the file blocks, either skipping or parsing metadata blocks
    Returntype : Void

=head2 next

    Description: Business logic of the iterator
                 Reads blocks of data from the file, determines whether they contain 
                 metadata or an actual record, optionally processes the metadata, and
                 terminates when a record has been loaded.
    Returntype : True/False depending on whether a record was found.

    Description: whether metadata was changed since the previous record
    Returntype : Boolean 

=cut

=head2 seek

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined seek function.
                 Function must allow the user to request that all the subsequent 
                 records be part of a given genomic region.
    Returntype : Void

=cut

sub seek {
    throw("Method not implemented. Might not be applicable to your file format.");
}

=head2 read_block

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined IO function.
                 Function must obtain and store the next block (e.g. line) of data from
                 the file.
    Returntype : Void 

=cut

sub read_block {
    throw("Method not implemented. This is really important");
}

=head2 is_metadata

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined metadata function.
                 Function must determine whether $self->{'current_block'}
                 contains metadata or not.
    Returntype : Boolean

=cut

sub is_metadata {
    throw("Method not implemented. This is really important");
}

=head2 read_metadata

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined metadata function.
                 Function must go through $self-{'current_block'},
                 extract relevant metadata, and store it in 
                 $self->{'metadata'}
    Returntype : Boolean

=cut

=head2 read_record

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined record lexing function.
                 Function must pre-process the data in $self->current block so that it is
                 readily available to accessor methods.
    Returntype : Void 

=cut

sub read_record {
    throw("Method not implemented. This is really important");
}

=head2 open

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined filehandling function.
                 Function must prepare input streams.
    Returntype : True/False on success/failure

=cut

sub open {
    throw("Method not implemented. This is really important");

=head2 close

    Description: Placeholder for user-defined filehandling function.
                 Function must close all open input streams.
    Returntype : True/False on success/failure
