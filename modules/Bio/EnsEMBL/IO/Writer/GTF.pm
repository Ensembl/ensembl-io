=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Writer::GTF - Generic GTF Writer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Writer::GTF;

  my $writer = Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Writer::GTF->new($translator);

  $writer->write($object);

=head1 Description

  Write records out in GTF format. The module uses a translator given
  at creation time which knows how to interrogate a specified type
  of feature/object that will be passed in to the write function.

  As in, for the GTF format the translator must know how to retrieve
  seqname, source, type, start, end, score, strand, phase and attributes
  fromt he objects you plan to feed the writer.

=head2 new

    Description: Constructor for a column based generic writer
    Args[1]    : Translator object for the type of object being written 
                 (ie. for Ensembl Features, etc)

}

=head2 combine_fields

    Description: For fields that are composite fields (ie. attributes in
                 GTF), combine the pieces of the field using the correct
                 delimiters for GTF
    Returntype : String of concatenated fields
