=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Object::GFF3 - Generic object for holding GFF3 based records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Object::GFF3;
  use Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Parser::GFF3;

  my $parser = Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Parser::GFF3->open('myfile.gff3');
  my $obj = Bio::EnsEMBL::IO::Object::GFF3->new($parser->get_fields);

  $obj->munrge_seqname('my_seq');

=head1 Description

An object derived from ColumnBasedGeneric with a specialized create_record to properly
format the record as GFF3 and map the strand to the correct values type (+/-)
rather than GFF3 as the generic object does.
